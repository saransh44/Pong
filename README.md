# **Pong**
Recreation of Pong using OpenGL and SDL

#### What are some unique features?

Well thank you for asking. 

1. pseudorandom speed
2. tunnel-like behavior with pseudorandom ball behavior: if you can be accurate enough to catch the ball with one side of the paddle and your paddle continues moving a bit, the ball will basically follow your paddle like its a tunnel and get spit out in a psuedorandom direction from the other side of the paddle. 

#### What is the glitched and working one?

Inside Pong > P2 folder is the working version/solution as P2.sln

Inside Pong > P2Glitched folder is the glitched version as a different P2.sln. 

Sorry about naming both solutions P2.sln
